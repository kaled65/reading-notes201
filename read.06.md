- The **table** element is used to create a table. 
- The **tr** to indicate the start of each row (table row).
- **td** to represent Each cell of the table (table data). 
### Table heading:
- **th** to represent the heading for either a column or a row (table heading).
### Spanning rows:
- The **colspan** attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.
### Spanning columns:
- The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
### Long Tables:
- There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows.
1. **thead** element includes The headings of the table.
2. **tbody** element includes the body of the element. 
3. **tfoot** element inclides the footer of the element. 

# JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY:
## chapter:3 “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
### Creating an object constructor notation:
- Using the new keyword and the object constructor, you can create a blank object. Then, you can add properties and methods to that object. 
### Updating an object:
- To update the value of properties dot notation or square brackets. They work on objects created using literal or construction notation. To delete a property, use the delete keyword. 
### CREATING MANY OBJECTS: CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION 
- Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
- The new keyword followes by a call to the function creates a new object. 
- The properties of each object are given as arguments to the function. 
### Arrays are objects:
- Arrays are speical type of object. The hold a related set of key-value pairs(like all objects), but the key for each value is its index number. 
### Arrays of objects and & objects in arrays: 
- You combine arrays and objects to create a complex data structures. arrays cn store a series of objects(and remember their order). Objects can also hlod arrays(as values of their properties).
