### CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements: 
- CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
-  A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
- **Selectors**  indicate which element the rule applies to.
- **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
### CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed:
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. 
- **Properties** indicate the aspects of the element you want to
change.
- **Values** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen
properties.
