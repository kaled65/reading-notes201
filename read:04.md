### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?:
- A function is a series of statments used to achieve a specific goal. There are some concepts related to functions such as: <br >
    1. **Calling a finction** refers to the act that asks a function to perform a task. 
    2. **Parameters** are pieces of information that the function needs to perform its task. 
    3. **Return values** the answer the functions provide. 
### Declaring a function:
- **Function declaration** is to create a function by giving it a name and writing the statements needed to achieve a task inside a curly braces.
### Calling a function:
- to call a function, you write the name of the function followed by parentheses. 
### Declaring a function that needs information:
- if a function needs information to work, you pass that infomation in parentheses after the function name. 
### calling functions that need information:
- when you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or varibles.
### Return Staement: 
- functions sometimes return information to the code that called them.
- functions can return more than one value using an array.
### FUNCTION EXPRESSION :
-  **Function expression** to put a finction inside a variable.
- **anonymous function** is a function without name. 
### IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS:
- **iffy** means to execute a function once as the interpreter comes across it. 
### VARIABLE SCOPE:
1. **LOCAL VARIABLES**: When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. 
2. **GLOBAL VARIABLES**: If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script.
