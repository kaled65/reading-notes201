# HTML & css design and build web sites:
## Chapter: 4 Links (pp.74-93)
### Writing Links:
- To create a link, use the **a** element. You specify which page you want to link to using the **href** attribute.
### Linking to other sites:
- **absolute URL** When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web
address for the site.
### Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site: 
- **relative URL** When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL.
### relative Urls:
- Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
### Email Links:
- **mailto:** element is used To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address. When using **mailto:** element the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
### Opening Links in a New Window: 
- **target** attribute is used to open a link in a new window.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?:
- A function is a series of statments used to achieve a specific goal. There are some concepts related to functions such as: <br >
    1. **Calling a finction** refers to the act that asks a function to perform a task. 
    2. **Parameters** are pieces of information that the function needs to perform its task. 
    3. **Return values** the answer the functions provide. 
### Declaring a function:
- **Function declaration** is to create a function by giving it a name and writing the statements needed to achieve a task inside a curly braces.
### Calling a function:
- to call a function, you write the name of the function followed by parentheses. 
### Declaring a function that needs information:
- if a function needs information to work, you pass that infomation in parentheses after the function name. 
### calling functions that need information:
- when you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments, and they can be provided as values or varibles.
### Return Staement: 
- functions sometimes return information to the code that called them.
- functions can return more than one value using an array.
### FUNCTION EXPRESSION :
-  **Function expression** to put a finction inside a variable.
- **anonymous function** is a function without name. 
### IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS:
- **iffy** means to execute a function once as the interpreter comes across it. 
### VARIABLE SCOPE:
1. **LOCAL VARIABLES**: When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. 
2. **GLOBAL VARIABLES**: If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script.
# Article: 6 Reasons for pair programming: 
### How does pair programming work?:
- Pair programming has two main roles:
1. the Driver: The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
2. the navigator: The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
### Why pair program? :
- It has a great number of advantages to the programmers demonstrated in the ability to complete assignemts, improve communiction skills, do better in interview, and getting used to work in a company that uses this technique. 
- Here is a more detailed picture of these benefit:
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
