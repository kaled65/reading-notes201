### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
- **Objects** group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In objects, variables and functions have different names: <br >
- As for variables, they are called **PROPERTIES** and functions are **methods**.
### Creating an object: Literal Notation 
- **Literal Notation** is one of the ways to create an object.
- The object is stored in a variable. Each property's key and value are seperated by a colon and each property i seperated by a comma.

- You can access the properties or methods of an object using the dot notation.
- You can also access properties using square brackets. 

## Chapter:5 Document Object Model: (pp.183-242)
### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE:
- As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.
The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes. 
    1. THE DOCUMENT NODE 
    2. ELEMENT NODES
    3. ATTRIBUTE NODES
    4. TEXT NODES 
### WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE: 
- Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 
    1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to    work with.
    2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 
### caching DOM queries:  
- **DOM queries** refer to the methods that find element in the DOM tree.
